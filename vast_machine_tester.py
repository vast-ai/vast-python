# =============================================================================
# Script Name: vast_offer_tester.py
# Description:
#     This Python script automates the process of searching for offers using the
#     VAST tool, filtering unverified offers (when specified), selecting the best
#     offers based on deep learning performance (dlperf), and performing self-tests
#     on the associated machines. The results of these tests are then saved to
#     output files, and a summary of failures is presented.
#
# Dependencies:
#     - subprocess: To execute external commands.
#     - json: To parse JSON data.
#     - concurrent.futures (ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed): To handle concurrent
#       execution of machine tests.
#     - threading: To manage thread-safe operations.
#     - datetime: To timestamp the results.
#     - tqdm: For progress bars (though not used in the current script).
#     - time & random: To implement retry logic with random backoff.
#     - collections (Counter): To count failure reasons.
#     - tabulate: To format the failure summary table.
#     - argparse: To parse command-line arguments.
#
# Functions:
#
#     run_vast_search(verified, host_id):
#         Executes the VAST search command to retrieve offers based on the provided
#         verification status and host ID. It limits the results to 65,535 offers and
#         includes both verified and unverified offers in raw JSON format. If the
#         command fails, it returns an empty list.
#
#     get_unverified_offers(offers):
#         Filters the list of offers to identify unverified offers whose
#         machine IDs are not present in any verified offers. This ensures that
#         only truly unverified offers are processed.
#
#     get_best_offers(offers):
#         From the list of offers, selects the best offer for each
#         machine based on the highest deep learning performance (dlperf). This
#         results in a dictionary mapping machine IDs to their best offer.
#
#     test_machine(machine_id):
#         Performs a self-test on a given machine by executing the
#         './vast.py self-test machine <machine_id> --raw' command. It includes
#         robust error handling with up to 30 retries in case of rate limiting
#         (HTTP 429 errors). The function returns a tuple containing the machine
#         ID, status ('success' or 'failure'), and a reason for failure if any.
#
#     process_machine_ids(machine_ids):
#         Manages the concurrent execution of self-tests on multiple machines
#         using a ThreadPoolExecutor with a maximum of 10 worker threads. It
#         tracks the number of processed, passed, and failed tests, and updates
#         the user on the progress in real-time. The function returns lists of
#         successful and failed machine IDs.
#
#     save_results(successes, failures):
#         Saves the results of the self-tests to two separate files:
#             - 'passed_machines.txt': Contains a timestamp and a comma-separated
#               list of machine IDs that passed the tests.
#             - 'failed_machines.txt': Contains a timestamp and a list of machine
#               IDs that failed, along with the reasons for failure.
#
#     print_failure_summary(failures):
#         Generates and prints a summary table of failure reasons using the
#         'tabulate' library. If 'tabulate' is not installed, it falls back to
#         basic string formatting. This provides a clear overview of why tests
#         failed across different machines.
#
#     parse_arguments():
#         Parses command-line arguments using argparse.
#
#     main():
#         The main orchestrator function that ties together all other functions.
#         It performs the following steps:
#             1. Parses command-line arguments for verification status and host ID.
#             2. Runs a VAST search to retrieve offers based on the provided filters.
#             3. Conditionally filters to get unverified offers if verification is set to false.
#             4. Selects the best offers based on download performance.
#             5. Processes the machine IDs by performing self-tests.
#             6. Saves the results to output files.
#             7. Prints a summary of the test results.
#
# Execution:
#     When the script is run directly, the 'main()' function is invoked, executing
#     the entire workflow described above.
#
# Error Handling:
#     - The script includes comprehensive error handling for subprocess commands,
#       including retries with exponential backoff in case of rate limiting.
#     - It handles JSON parsing errors and unexpected exceptions gracefully,
#       ensuring that failures are logged with appropriate reasons.
#
# Output:
#     - 'passed_machines.txt': Lists machine IDs that successfully passed the
#       self-tests.
#     - 'failed_machines.txt': Lists machine IDs that failed the self-tests along
#       with the reasons for failure.
#     - Console Output: Provides real-time updates on the progress of tests and
#       a summary of results upon completion.
#
# Usage:
#     Ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the './vast' and
#     './vast.py' commands are available and executable. Run the script using:
#         python3 vast_offer_tester.py [--verified {true,false,any}] [--host_id HOST_ID]
#
#     Options:
#         --verified {true,false,any}   Set the verification status to filter offers.
#                                       Default is 'false'.
#         --host_id HOST_ID            Specify a particular host ID to filter offers.
#                                       Use 'any' for no filtering. Default is 'any'.
#         -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit.
#
# Example:
#     To search for verified offers with host_id 12345:
#         python3 vast_offer_tester.py --verified true --host_id 12345
# 
# Results saved to 'passed_machines.txt' and 'failed_machines.txt'.
